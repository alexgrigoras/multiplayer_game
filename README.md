# Multiplayer Web Game

## Description
A 2-player game similar to agar.io in which players are represented by circles that grow bigger when they eat other spawned circles.

The demo of the application is available [here](https://alexgrigoras.github.io/multiplayer_game/). The application has only the frontend available because the nodejs backend is not hosted anywhere. To test the application, clone the repository and run it locally.
